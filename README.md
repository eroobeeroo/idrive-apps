# idrive-apps

Tools and apps for the iDrive 7 head unit (MGU) of a BMW, installed from the
[mgu Store](https://github.com/robertnisipeanu/mgu-store).

| Path | |
|---|---|
| [`native/cluster-render`](native/cluster-render) | the cluster renderer: one service that draws every app's layers on the instrument cluster and the HUD, on iDrive 7 and iDrive 8 |
| [`native/waze-on-cluster`](native/waze-on-cluster) | the CarPlay map (Waze, Apple Maps or Google Maps) on the instrument cluster, drawn through cluster-render |
| [`apps/robertn_waze_cluster`](apps/robertn_waze_cluster) | the iDrive app for it: Enable map, Disable map, status |
| [`release`](release) | builds and publishes the Store catalog |
| `tools` | `oap_pack.js`, `oap_link.js`: pack the app |

## The map on the HUD

The Waze tool can show the CarPlay map (Waze or Google Maps) on the head-up display instead of the instrument
cluster, switched from the app's page. HUD support was contributed by [eroobeeroo](https://github.com/eroobeeroo).

*The HUD map while driving: the route, the next streets and the speed readout over the road. (The panel at the
bottom right, battery power and temperatures, is a separate app.)*

| Before: Waze's grey-blue night field on the HUD | After: the background made black, which a HUD shows as nothing |

- **Show map on: Cluster / HUD** - one button moves the map between the instrument cluster and the HUD, at once.
- **Size** - **HUD map larger / smaller** in 5 % steps from 30 % to 85 % of the HUD's width, the picture's shape
  kept. Standard is the fitted box, about 57 %.
- **Position** - **Move HUD map left / right / up / down**, 10 px a press, and **Centre HUD map**. The map moves at
  once (only its place changes) and is held inside the HUD.
- **Made for a HUD** - the frames are scaled on the head unit to the size shown (sharper, 2-6x less data to the
  instrument cluster), the corners are rounded, and a night map's background is made black so only the roads,
  route and labels float in view (green, such as parks, is kept).
- **Gives way** - the map steps aside while the HUD's own media and list pop-ups show.
- **Per driver** - the display choice, size and position are kept for each driver profile.

On the cluster, as before, the map fills the central area:

## Install

In the Store, add the GitHub source `robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps` and install
**Waze on cluster**. The Store installs what it requires first: `mgu-deploy`
0.7.0 from mgu-store, then `cluster-render` and the Waze tool from here. One
head-unit start activates the CarPlay patch. The Store removes them again:
the app, then the tool, then the renderer.

## Build

```sh
make -C native/cluster-render test test-x86 target    # host tests; the unit's toolchain and binary (Docker)
make -C native/waze-on-cluster test test-x86 target
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_control.js
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_page.js
node release/test/release_test.js
node release/release.js check                         # reproducible artifacts
```

Each folder's README has the details; [`release/README.md`](release/README.md)
covers versions, the catalog and publishing.
